# Email Manager in Vue and Express ⚡️

## Project Briefing

This project was one of the first ever projects I posted on Github. I was pursuing a course on Vue and this project was part of the course. Recently, I decided to revisit this now that I am significantly more experienced with Vue. I also decided to add a back-end to this as well in Express and include test cases.
